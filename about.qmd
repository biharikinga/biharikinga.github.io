I grew up in the east Bay Area, but both my parents were born in Hungary and I was raised maintaining my Hungarian identity, which I still proudly foster today. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.A. in Environmental Studies in June 2024. My research interests lie in ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics, especially in regard to soil carbon stocks and wetland ecosystems. I currently work as a data scientist in the Climate Change Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. As part of my job I've become acquainted with the world of climate models and their limitations when it comes to modeling carbon feedbacks. I would love to contribute to the body of research informing more accurate climate models through my own field research.

Outside of work, I like cooking and baking, and I'm known to make a mean banana bread. I also love all things outdoors, including the beautiful beaches Santa Barbara has to offer, biking, hiking and camping. My favorite camping spot has been Santa Cruz Island, the biggest of the California Channel Islands. I'm a big fan of reality tv to relax and laugh, as well as attending comedy shows.
