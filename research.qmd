While at UCSB, I've been lucky to have taken part in the amazing research done here. My most notable projects have been:

1. Analyzing Plant Tissue Chemistry of *Salicornia pacifica* in Restored and Established Wetlands

2. Evaluating the effect of food-based lure and predator scent on detectability of mainland rodents with implications for biosecurity on the California Channel Islands 

3. Assessing agrivoltaic suitability across agricultural land in California through geospatial analysis
