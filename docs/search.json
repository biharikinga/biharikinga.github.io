    "text": "I grew up in the Bay Area, but both my parents were born in Hungary and I was raised maintaining my Hungarian identity, which I still proudly foster today. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.A. in Environmental Studies in 2024 and plan to go to grad school. I currently work as a data scientist in the Climate Change Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. The primary projects I’ve contributed to are EPA’s Climate Change Indicators and reduced complexity model FrEDI, which projects future climate change impacts within the U.S. under any custom temperature or emissions pathway.\n\nMy research interests lie in ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics, especially with regard to soil carbon stocks and wetland ecosystems. As part of my job I’ve become acquainted with the world of climate models, and have come to appreciate their complexity and role in climate mitigation, as well as their limitations when it comes to modeling carbon feedbacks. In my future research I would love to contribute to the body of research informing more accurate climate models through my own field work.\n\nOutside of work, I like cooking and baking, and I’m known to make a mean banana bread. I also love all things outdoors, including biking, hiking and camping. My favorite camping spot has been Santa Cruz Island, the biggest of the California Channel Islands. I’m a big fan of reality tv to relax and laugh, as well as attending comedy shows.\n\nKinga’s CV"

It’s written in all in Hungarian, except for a short reflection/summary in English on page 23.\nThis project is a culmination of a year-long research project I conducted to tie together my dual Hungarian-American identity and my passion for the environment."

    "text": "While at UCSB, I’m proud to have taken part in the amazing research done here. My most notable projects have been:\n\nAnalyzing plant tissue chemistry of Salicornia pacifica in restored and established wetlands  As my senior thesis project, I independently designed and executed a study examining the carbon, nitrogen, and carbon:nitrogen ratios in a common coastal wetland plant, pickleweed. The manuscript was published in UCSB’s Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities Journal. I presented this poster at multiple undergraduate research symposia at UCSB. I completed this project with the incredible support of Dr. Jennifer King’s DECOMP lab.\nEvaluating the effect of food-based lure and predator scent on detectability of mainland rodents with implications for biosecurity on the California Channel Islands\nDuring a fellowship I completed with the UCSB Bren School and The Nature Conservancy, I executed a field-based study examining the detection probability of potentially invasive rodents to the Channel Islands with different types of lures. My co-author Ray did an oral presentation at the California Islands Symposium on our research, and I presented a poster version at multiple symposia held at UCSB. We submitted this draft for publishing and it is currently under revisions before it (hopefully) gets published in the Western North American Naturalist.\nAssessing agrivoltaic suitability across agricultural land in California through geospatial analysis\nAs part of a scholarship I won for environmental research, I conducted an independent research project exploring the suitability of dual land-use colocation of solar panels and agricultural crop production in California. The manuscript was also published in UCSB’s Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities Journal."
