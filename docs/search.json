    "text": "I grew up in the east Bay Area, but both my parents were born in Hungary and I was raised maintaining my Hungarian identity, which I still proudly foster today. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.A. in Environmental Studies in June 2024. My research interests lie in ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics, especially in regard to soil carbon stocks and wetland ecosystems. climate change mitigation and habitat restoration, which is in itself an important part of fighting climate change. I currently work as a data scientist in the Climate Change Division of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. As part of my jobI’m excited to use everything I’ve learned at UCSB in this next chapter of my life!\n\nOutside of work, I like cooking and baking, and I’m known to make a mean banana bread. I also love all things outdoors, including the beautiful beaches Santa Barbara has to offer, biking, hiking and camping. My favorite camping spot has been Santa Cruz Island, the biggest of the California Channel Islands. I’m a big fan of reality tv to relax and laugh, as well as attending comedy shows.\n\nResume:\nKinga’s resume replace this!"

It’s written in all in Hungarian, except for a short reflection/summary in English on page 23.\nThis project is a culmination of a year-long research project I conducted to tie together my dual Hungarian-American identity and my passion for the environment."

My most notable projects have been:\n\nAnalyzing plant tissue chemistry of Salicornia pacifica in restored and established wetlands As my senior thesis project, I independently designed and executed a study examining the carbon, nitrogen, and carbon:nitrogen ratios in a common coastal wetland plant, pickleweed. This poster is what I presented at multiple undergraduate research symposia, and I will be submitting the WIP final report to an undergraduate journal.\nEvaluating the effect of food-based lure and predator scent on detectability of mainland rodents with implications for biosecurity on the California Channel Islands\nDuring a fellowship I completed with the UCSB Bren School and The Nature Conservancy, I executed a field-based study examining the detection probability of potentially invasive rodents to the Channel Islands with different types of lures. We submitted this draft for publishing and it is currently under revisions before it (hopefully) gets published in the Western North American Naturalist.\nAssessing agrivoltaic suitability across agricultural land in California through geospatial analysis\nAs part of a scholarship I won for environmental research, I conducted an independent research project exploring the suitability of dual land-use colocation of solar panels and agricultural crop production in California. I will also be submitting WIP report to an undergraduate journal.\ninclude fredi, include"
